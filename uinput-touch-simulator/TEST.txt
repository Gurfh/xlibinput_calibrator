Test to perform:

- open two text windows
- in the 1st one, run: 
    $ sudo ./uinput-touch-simulation <PATTERN>
- press ENTER
- in the 2nd one, execute (before the timeout of 3 seconds)
    $ ./xlibinput_calibrator --verbose --show-xinput-cmd
- wait the calibration completition
- in the 1st window:
- exit (CTRL-c) from 'uinput-touch-simulation'
- run
    $ sudo ./uinput-touch-simulation 3210 --move --extreme
- in the 2nd window:
- copy and paste the output starting from 'xinput set-float-prop '... until
  the 9th float number
- in the 1st window press ENTER
- check that the mouse move from the center to the 4 corners in the following
  order:
  	1) center -> top left
	2) center -> top right
	3) center -> bottom left
	4) center -> bottom right

Repeat the test above for the following <PATTERN>:
- 0123   (default)
- 2031   (rotate)
- 2301   (vertical mirror)
- 1032   (horizontal mirror)
- 0213   (rotate + horizontal mirror)
- 3210   (vertical + horizontal mirror)
 

In case of multi-monitord setup:
- check that the in the previous test the mouse pointer movement is INSIDE the
primary monitor. 
- Append the following option
   --monitor-number=-1
to the xlibinput-calibrator command, and check that the mouse movement is
through all the monitors.
- Append the following option
   --monitor-number=1
to the xlibinput-calibrator command, and check that the mouse moves movement is
inside the secondary monitor.

This program create a "virtual touch screen device". The program access the
/dev/uinput device, so it need the privileges.

The program may work in two way:

- Touch mode:
After creating the virtual device, the program ask the point to click.
A point is defined by a digit in the range 0..3. Each point match a 
corner:
0 -> upper left
1 -> upper right
2 -> bottom left
3 -> bottom right

- Mouse move mode (use the switch --move)
After creating the virtual device, the program ask the point of click.
If the user set (using for example 'xinput set-float-prop') another
calibration matrix before pressing ENTER, it is possible to test it.
In this mode, the mouse pointer is moved from the center of the touch of the
4 corners. 

By default, the corner is at 1/8 (or 7/8) of the the edge of the touch. If
the switch --extereme is passed, the corner is the *real* corner of the
touch.

This program is mainly a tool to debug xlibinput_calibrator.
